## General Info üìù

This project automates extracting daily transacations email data from my personal Gmail and storing it my [Google Sheets monthly budget tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UiPi9wQHIbUpB2RSI0ybCbwW2PcYtrONFho83VuiTu4/edit#gid=0). Can manually run locally or set up in AWS lamda. I have lamdba run every day at 8:00AM PST to fetch previous day transactions. I have email notifications turned for each of my credit cards and venmo to send me alerts whenever I make a purchase.
